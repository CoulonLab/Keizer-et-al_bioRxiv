Channels are:
1. Force in the x direction
2. Force in the y direction
3. Force in the z direction (note: inaccurate due to bleaching)
4. GFP image, after flat-field correction and normalization by TMR channel
5. Masks where force estimation is expected to be accurate
6. Manually-placed landmark to locate and register the tip of the pillars


Procedure to produce his file:
- Each field of view was generated using scripts `computeForceField_v1.1.10.ijm` and `makeForceFieldMask_v1.0.1.ijm` (see instructions therein) and concatenated together.
- A 6th channel was added with black (0 filled) frames and a pixel was set to a non-0 value on the z-plane of the surface of the coverglass, at a location to identify the tip of the pillar (i.e. the corner of the square if the pillar was a perfect square)
- The different images were then registered on this landmark using the 'Correct 3D drift` Fiji plugin
- z-planes below the coverglass and much above the top of the pillar were removed.

This tif file can be used as an input for the calibration of the simulated force map.
