Supporting data, software and documentation for the study by Keizer et al. 2021

This repository aims at providing the complete set of data, parameters and documentation in order to reproduce the results described in the study.

## Journal article
This study has not undergone peer review yet ; we will upload it to a preprint server soon.

## Outline of this repository
We created one folder per type of experiment. We then included subfolders or links to the movies (uploaded on the [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/) platform) corresponding to successive steps of analysis. A last folder named "[figures](./figures)" contains the code used to generate the figures of the preprint.
