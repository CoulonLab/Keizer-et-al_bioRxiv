# Code to simulate or measure/infer the force field

We undertook two parallel approaches to estimate the force field around the pillar (and thus the force experienced by the locus):
- An empirical approach, in which we performed confocal-microscopy-based experiments to recover the force field
- A computer-simulation-based approach, in which we simulated the value of the force field using finite elements solvers
